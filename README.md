# Mark Greenfield

### Basic Info

I live in the Philadelphia area with my wife and dog. 
I work as a **Quantitative Researcher** at *Susquehanna International Group*.

### Background

I grew up in several different parts of the USA, and studied mathematics in college and graduate school.
I completed my PhD in 2021, and have been working at SIG since then. 

### This page

I am working on expanding my computing and data science skills. I am working through a few online minicourses, including the UNIX Workbench on Coursera.
This repository was created during it. Maybe I will use it for other projects soon.
